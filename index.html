    <h2>1. It’s not one big thing</h2>

    </p>
    <p>You may well ask: “How can I start using <abbr>HTML5</abbr> if older browsers don’t support it?” But the question
        itself is misleading. <abbr>HTML5</abbr> is not one big thing; it is a collection of individual features. So you
        can’t detect “<abbr>HTML5</abbr> support,” because that doesn’t make any sense. But you <em>can</em> detect
        support for individual features, like canvas, video, or geolocation.

    </p>
    <p>You may think of <abbr>HTML</abbr> as tags and angle brackets. That’s an important part of it, but it’s not the
        whole story. The <abbr>HTML5</abbr> specification also defines how those angle brackets interact with
        JavaScript, through the Document Object Model (<abbr>DOM</abbr>). <abbr>HTML5</abbr> doesn’t just define a
        <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag; there is also a corresponding <abbr>DOM</abbr> <abbr>API</abbr> for video
        objects in the <abbr>DOM</abbr>. You can use this <abbr>API</abbr> to detect support for different video
        formats, play a video, pause, mute audio, track how much of the video has been downloaded, and everything else
        you need to build a rich user experience around the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag itself.

    </p>
    <p><a>Chapter 2</a> and <a>Appendix A</a> will teach you how to properly detect
        support for each new <abbr>HTML5</abbr> feature.

    </p>
    <h2>2. You don’t need to throw anything away</h2>

    <p><img src="./src/forms.png" width="134" height="196">

    </p>
    <p>Love it or hate it, you can’t deny that <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4 is the most successful markup format ever.
        <abbr>HTML5</abbr> builds on that success. You don’t need to throw away your existing markup. You don’t need to
        relearn things you already know. If your web application worked yesterday in <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4, it will still
        work today in <abbr>HTML5</abbr>. Period.

    </p>
    <p>Now, if you want to <em>improve</em> your web applications, you’ve come to the right place. Here’s a concrete
        example: <abbr>HTML5</abbr> supports all the form controls from <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4, but it also includes new
        input controls. Some of these are long-overdue additions like sliders and date pickers; others are more subtle.
        For example, the <code>email</code> input type looks just like a text box, but mobile browsers will customize
        their onscreen keyboard to make it easier to type email addresses. Older browsers that don’t support the
        <code>email</code> input type will treat it as a regular text field, and the form still works with no markup
        changes or scripting hacks. This means you can start improving your web forms <em>today</em>, even if some of
        your visitors are stuck on IE 6.

    </p>
    <p>Read all the gory details about <abbr>HTML5</abbr> forms in <a>Chapter 9</a>.

    <h2>3. It’s easy to get started</h2>

    <p><img src="./src/markup-with-arrow.png" width="234"
            height="202">

    </p>
    <p>“Upgrading” to <abbr>HTML5</abbr> can be as simple as changing your <i>doctype</i>. The doctype should already be
        on the first line of every <abbr>HTML</abbr> page. Previous versions of <abbr>HTML</abbr> defined a lot of
        doctypes, and choosing the right one could be tricky. In <abbr>HTML5</abbr>, there is only one doctype:

    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Upgrading to the <abbr>HTML5</abbr> doctype won’t break your existing markup, because <a>obsolete elements</a>
        previously
        defined in HTML 4 will still render in <abbr>HTML5</abbr>. But it will allow you to use — and validate — new
        semantic elements like <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>,
        and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>. You’ll learn all about these new elements in <a>Chapter 3</a>.

    </p>
    <h2>4. It already works</h2>

    <p><img src="./src/rel-email.png" width="227"

    </p>
    <p>Whether you want to draw on a canvas, play video, design better forms, or build web applications that work
        offline, you’ll find that <abbr>HTML5</abbr> is already well-supported. Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera, and
        mobile browsers already support canvas (<a>Chapter 4</a>), video
        (<a>Chapter 5</a>), geolocation (<a>Chapter 6</a>), local storage (<a>Chapter 7</a>), and more. Google already
        supports microdata
        annotations (<a>Chapter 10</a>). Even Microsoft — rarely
        known for blazing the trail of standards support — supports most <abbr>HTML5</abbr> features in Internet
        Explorer 9.

    <p>Each chapter of this book includes the all-too-familiar browser compatibility charts. But more importantly, each
        chapter includes a frank discussion of your options if you need to support older browsers. <abbr>HTML5</abbr>
        features like geolocation (<a>Chapter 6</a>) and video (<a>Chapter 5</a>) were first provided by browser plugins
        like
        Gears or Flash. Other features, like canvas (<a>Chapter 4</a>),
        can be emulated entirely in JavaScript. This book will teach you how to target the native features of modern
        browsers, without leaving older browsers behind.

    <h2>5. It’s here to stay</h2>

    <p>Tim Berners-Lee invented the world wide web in the early 1990s. He later founded the <abbr>W3C</abbr> to act as a
        steward of web standards, which the organization has done for more than 15 years. Here is what the
        <abbr>W3C</abbr> had to say about the future of web standards, in July 2009:

    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Today the Director announces that when the <abbr>XHTML</abbr> 2 Working Group charter expires as scheduled at
            the end of 2009, the charter will not be renewed. By doing so, and by increasing resources in the
            <abbr>HTML</abbr> Working Group, <abbr>W3C</abbr> hopes to accelerate the progress of <abbr>HTML5</abbr> and
            clarify <abbr>W3C</abbr>’s position regarding the future of <abbr>HTML</abbr>.
        </p>
